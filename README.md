# Sequential Deep Learning Model - Customer Segmentation

The aim of this project is to design a deep learning model to accurately predict whether a customer will subscribe to the focus product of a marketing campaign.
The dataset used contains details of marketing campaigns done via phone with various details for customers such as demographics, last campaign details etc. 

## Prerequisites

This script uses the following python libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. SciPy
4. Scikit-Learn
5. TensorFlow
6. MatPlotLib
7. Seaborn

## Model Architecture
The following figure shows the default model architecture used in the script.

## Results

As the model trains, the loss and accuracy metrics are displayed using TensorBoard. This model reaches an accuracy of about 0.9 (or 90%) on the training data.

The following figures display how the model performs on the test dataset:

![Confusion matrix](static/confusion_matrix.png)

Category 1 has a low f1-score of 0.47. This is likely due to the imbalance between the counts of Category 0 and 1 in the original dataset, which is 28253 (89%) & 3394 (11%) respectively. Imputational methods such as SMOTE might be beneficial to improve the performance of the model.
